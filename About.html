      <p>My name is Gabriel. I am now currently a student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic School of ICT and I am currently studying for a diploma in IT.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When I was a Secondary 4 student, I was the vice-president of the InfoComm Club.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In my 4 years of being in the InfoComm Club, I have represented my previous school, Montfort Secondary in numerous national competitions and brought many noteworthy achievements.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My previous CCA role also required me to conduct lessons on Scratch2 and Python to my juniors. Since then i have learnt C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am full of drive and thinks out of the box to solve complex problems.</p>
